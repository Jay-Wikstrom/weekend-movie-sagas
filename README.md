## Description

In this project the user will access a gallery of movies.  When a poster is clicked the user is taken to a details page where they can see genres and a description of the movie. The user can return to the home page.  At the bottom of the home page is an Add Movie button which brings the users to a new page where they can add a title, description, genre, and poster of a movie. If the user does not want to add a movie then they can click cancel which will return them to the home page.
