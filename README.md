# Project Name

Weekend-Movie-Sagas

## Description

This project took me a weekend to build.
In this project the user will access a gallery of movies.  When a poster is clicked the user is taken to a details page where they can see genres and a description of the movie. The user can return to the home page.  At the bottom of the home page is an Add Movie button which brings the users to a new page where they can add a title, description, genre, and poster of a movie. If the user does not want to add a movie then they can click cancel which will return them to the home page.

Here is how you get this app running on your own machine:

Create a database named saga_movies_weekend,
The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
Run npm run server in your terminal
Run npm run client in your terminal
The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!
